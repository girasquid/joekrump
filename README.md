## 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Joe!

I love solving problems together with other people, often through conversation and code! Reach out on [LinkedIn](ca.linkedin.com/in/joekrump/) if you think there's an opportunity for us to work together on something.

- 🔭 I’m currently an Engineering Manager working with my team on frontend infrastructure of [Clio](clio.com)'s web apps.
- 🌱 I’m growing my technical skills by learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
- 💪🏻 I've worked a lot with React, AngularJS, and TypeScript and also have some Ruby on Rails and Laravel experience.

### Some other things I'm leveling up in:
- 👨🏻‍🍳 Cooking
- 🎸 Playing ukulele
- ♟ Playing chess
